# E-commerce MVP
A minimal e-commerce web app built with Next.js, powered by Platzi Fake Store API.

## 🚀 Features
+ Product listing with categories
+ Cart functionality with quantity adjustment & removal
+ Responsive (if it is — if not, say “desktop-first MVP”)
+ Integrated with FakeStore API (or whichever API you used)
+ Uses AI-assisted component scaffolding for speed

## 🤖 How AI helped
+ Drafted initial UI components & layout suggestions
+ Suggested refactors for readability
+ Generated placeholder assets & styling ideas

## 🧪 Tech stack
+ Next.js (full-stack capabilities)
+ TailwindCSS (quick styling)
+ Platzi FakeStore API (to test the styling of cards, and better than Lorem ipsum)
+ TypeScript (for strict typing and conformity)

## 🎯 Learnings
+ AI can accelerate front-end dev, but human judgment is crucial for the positioning of elements and the working of UI.
+ Importance of testing API responses and mapping to interfaces to shape input data to work with other components.
+ Managing state & UI transitions effectively (like cart pane).
